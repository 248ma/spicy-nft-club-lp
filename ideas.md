  **Design Movement**: Cyberpunk Noir / High-Tech Luxury
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Exclusivity & Mystery**: Use shadows, masking, and reveal animations to create a sense of hidden value.
  2. **Digital Tactility**: Elements should feel like premium hardware interfaces (glass, brushed metal, neon accents).
  3. **Immersive Storytelling**: The scroll experience should feel like descending into a secret underground club.
  4. **Performance First**: Smooth, hardware-accelerated transitions that feel instantaneous and premium.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Deep Void Black (`#050505`) - Not just flat black, but a rich, deep darkness.
  - **Primary Accent**: Neon Magenta (`#ff0080`) - Represents passion, energy, and the "spicy" aspect.
  - **Secondary Accent**: Electric Purple (`#7928ca`) - Adds mystery, luxury, and digital depth.
  - **Highlight**: Holographic Silver - For text and borders, reflecting a premium metallic finish.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette combines the allure of nightlife with the cutting-edge feel of NFTs/Web3.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric & Overlapping**: Avoid rigid grids. Use overlapping layers of glass and content to create depth.
  - **Z-Axis Navigation**: Instead of just scrolling down, elements should feel like they are moving *towards* the user or the user is moving *through* them.
  - **Floating Elements**: Key CTAs and assets should float above the content, anchored by subtle parallax effects.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Ultra-thin, high-blur glass panels with noise textures and iridescent borders.
  - **Neon Glows**: Soft, pulsating glows behind key elements, acting as visual breathing.
  - **Glitch Accents**: Subtle, controlled glitch effects on hover or interaction to emphasize the digital nature of the NFT.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover-Reveal**: Information is teased; hovering reveals details with a smooth, magnetic pull.
  - **Scroll-Triggered Cinematics**: As the user scrolls, background videos and 3D elements shift perspective or focus.
  - **Micro-Haptics (Visual)**: Buttons press down visually, toggles snap with weight.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Staggered, fluid fades with slight scale-up (0.95 -> 1.0).
  - **Scroll**: Parallax layers moving at different speeds.
  - **Text**: Character-by-character decoding or smooth wipe reveals.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: `Montserrat` (Bold/Black) - Strong, geometric, modern. Used for headlines to command attention.
  - **Body**: `Noto Sans JP` (Regular/Light) - Clean, legible, supporting multiple languages elegantly.
  - **Mono**: `JetBrains Mono` or similar for data points (prices, token IDs) to add a technical edge.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Pop Art Luxury
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Bold Confidence**: High contrast, large typography, and unapologetic layout.
  2. **Raw & Refined**: Mixing raw structural elements (lines, borders) with refined imagery.
  3. **Playful Exclusivity**: Taking the "club" aspect literally - fun, vibrant, but hard to get into.
  4. **Directness**: Clear, punchy messaging without fluff.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Off-White / Paper (`#f0f0f0`) or Stark Black (`#111`).
  - **Accents**: Acid Green, Hot Pink, Electric Blue - pure, unadulterated RGB values.
  - **Borders**: Thick, solid black (`#000`) lines defining structure.
  - *Reasoning*: Stands out from the typical "dark mode crypto" aesthetic. It says "we are different, we are bold."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Visible grid lines, card-based layouts that stack and shuffle.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners for announcements and energy.
  - **Split Screens**: Dividing the screen into clear functional zones.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders & Shadows**: Hard shadows (no blur) to create a sticker/card effect.
  - **Collage Imagery**: Mixing photo-realism with vector graphics and typography.
  - **Brutalist Buttons**: Rectangular, sharp edges, immediate hover states (invert colors).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Click**: Interactions should feel mechanical and precise.
  - **Draggable Elements**: Allow users to move certain "stickers" or cards around.
  - **Cursor Effects**: Custom cursor that changes based on the zone (e.g., "MINT NOW" follows cursor).

  **Animation**:
  - **Hard Cuts**: Transitions are instant or very fast slides.
  - **Looping**: Constant subtle motion in background elements (marquees, spinning badges).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: `Druk Wide` or similar extended sans-serif - massive, loud.
  - **Body**: `Inter` or `Helvetica` - neutral, functional.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Minimalism / Digital Zen
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Serenity & Flow**: The experience should feel effortless and fluid.
  2. **Focus on Content**: The NFT art is the hero; the UI recedes.
  3. **Light & Shadow**: Using light sources to define hierarchy rather than borders.
  4. **Organic Tech**: Technology that feels natural and breathing.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Deep Midnight Blue or Soft Charcoal.
  - **Accents**: Bioluminescent Blues and Teals.
  - **Gradients**: Very subtle, long-form gradients that shift slowly.
  - *Reasoning*: Creates a sense of calm, trust, and high-end gallery atmosphere.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Central Axis**: Content flows down a central spine, branching out gently.
  - **Full-Screen Immersion**: Sections take up the full viewport, focusing on one idea at a time.
  - **Whitespace**: Massive amounts of negative space to frame the content.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Glows**: Elements emit light rather than reflect it.
  - **Frosted Glass**: Heavy blur, low opacity layers.
  - **Thin Lines**: Hairline dividers that fade out at the edges.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Scroll**: Inertia-based scrolling.
  - **Fade & Float**: Elements gently float into place.
  - **Ambient Audio**: (Optional) Subtle soundscapes triggered by scroll.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow Motion**: Everything moves with a heavy, underwater grace.
  - **Morphing**: Shapes morph into each other rather than sliding.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: `Cormorant Garamond` or elegant serif - sophisticated, classic.
  - **Body**: `Manrope` or geometric sans - modern, clean.
